debarnacle does essentially the same thing as cruft.  However, the
implementation is completely different.  It is written in carefully
optimized Perl instead of a mixture of C and shell.  It does not
artificially divide the filesystem by mount points, instead it does
one big "find /" to scan existing files.  And it doesn't make the
debatable distinction between "wanted" and "needed" files (although
the Glob plugin may be said to serve a similar purpose).

For details, please see the manpage, or use the source.

To many people, "Unix security" may seem to be an oxymoron.
